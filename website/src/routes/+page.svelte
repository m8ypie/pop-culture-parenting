  <p slot="content">Pop Culture Parenting is hosted by Nick (a developing parent) and Dr Billy Garvey (a developmental pediatrician). 
  <br/><br/>Our goal is to open a conversation about how we can better support our kids in their developmental and mental health. We use scenes from iconic 80’s + 90’s movies to bring the theory and advice to life!
  <br/><br/>This podcast is about going beyond the four walls of a clinic, learning together as parents and professionals, and creating a community in which kids grow and thrive.</p>
